11-18-2007     Fzj       5 hours       Added logic to compensate for speed
                                       There is a bug known where it will not 
                                       move completely over to the right like it 
                                       does to left.  I just added logic so that it would not
                                       get stuck because of this

11-19-2007     FZJ      3.5 hrs        Adde more advanced AI for tracking pacman
                                       looked into using Dijktra's algorithm but then
                                       realized it was unnecessary because I only need to travel
                                       part of the distance each time since pacman is a moving target
11-22-2007     FZJ      3.5 hrs        Refactored goblins into their own class which inherits from pacman
11-22-2007     FZJ       .5 hrs        Created TimerManager class in base to allow keeping track of timed events
